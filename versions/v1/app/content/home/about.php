	<h3>What is wykaPedia?</h3>    
    <p>
    	My name is Brian Wyka, and I am the founder of wykaPedia Web Design.  wykaPedia was originally just my homepage 
        on the internet, but after I started creating more web pages for myself and for friends, I decided to step up 
        and make wykaPedia Web Design.
